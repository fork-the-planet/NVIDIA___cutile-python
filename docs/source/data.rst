Data Model
==========

cuTile is an array-based programming model.
The fundamental data structure is the multidimensional array whose elements share a single
homogeneous type. cuTile Python exposes only arrays, not pointers.

An array-based model was chosen because:

- Arrays know their bounds, so accesses can be checked for safety and correctness.
- Array-based load/store operations can be efficiently lowered to speed-of-light hardware mechanisms.
- Python programmers are already familiar with array-based frameworks such as NumPy.
- Pointers are not a natural fit for Python.

Within |tile code|, only the types described in this section are supported.


.. _data-global-arrays:

Global Arrays
-------------

A *global array* (or *array*) is a container of elements of a specific |dtype|
arranged in a logical multidimensional space.

An array's *shape* is a tuple of integers, each denoting the length of the
corresponding dimension. The length of the shape tuple equals the array's number
of dimensions, and the product of its values equals the total number of logical
elements in the array.

Arrays are stored in global memory using a *strided memory layout*: in addition to a shape,
each array has an equally sized tuple of *strides* that maps logical indices to physical memory
locations. For example, for a 3-dimensional `float32` array with strides `(s1, s2, s3)`, the
memory address of the element at index `(i1, i2, i3)` is:

.. code-block::

    base_addr + 4 * (s1 * i1 + s2 * i2 + s3 * i3),

where ``base_addr`` is the base address of the array and ``4`` is the byte size of a ``float32``
element.

New arrays can only be allocated by the host and passed to the tile kernel as arguments.
|Tile code| can only create new views of existing arrays, for example via
:meth:`Array.slice`. As in Python, assigning an array to another variable does not copy
the underlying data but creates another reference to the same array.

Any object that implements the |DLPack| interface or the |CUDA Array Interface|
can be passed as a kernel argument --- for example, |CuPy| arrays and |PyTorch| tensors.

If two or more array arguments are passed to the kernel, their memory must not overlap.
Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

An array's shape can be queried with the :py:attr:`Array.shape` attribute, which
returns a tuple of `int32` scalars. These are non-constant, runtime values.
Using `int32` improves performance at the cost of capping the maximum representable
shape at 2,147,483,647 elements. This limitation will be lifted in the future.

.. _data-tiles-and-scalars:

Tiles and Scalars
-----------------
A *tile* is an immutable multidimensional collection of elements of a specific |dtype|.

A tile's *shape* is a tuple of integers, each denoting the length of the corresponding dimension.
The length of the shape tuple equals the tile's number of dimensions, and the product of its values
equals the total number of elements in the tile.

The shape of a tile must be known at compile time. Each dimension of a tile must be a power of 2.

A tile's dtype and shape can be queried with the ``dtype`` and ``shape`` attributes, respectively.
For example, if ``x`` is a `float32` tile, ``x.dtype`` returns a compile-time constant
equal to :py:data:`cuda.tile.float32`.

A zero-dimensional tile is called a *scalar*. A scalar has exactly one element and its shape is
the empty tuple `()`. Numeric literals like `7` or `3.14` are treated as constant scalars,
i.e. zero-dimensional tiles.

Because scalars are tiles, they differ slightly from Python's ``int``/``float`` objects.
For example, they have ``dtype`` and ``shape`` attributes:

.. code-block:: python

    a = 0
    # The following line will evaluate to cuda.tile.int32 in cuTile,
    # but would raise an AttributeError in Python:
    a.dtype

Tiles can only be used in |tile code|, not in host code.
A tile's contents do not necessarily have a physical representation in memory.
Tiles are created by loading from |global arrays| using functions such as
:py:func:`cuda.tile.load` and :py:func:`cuda.tile.gather`, or with |factory| functions
such as :py:func:`cuda.tile.zeros`.

Tiles can be stored back into global arrays using functions such as :py:func:`cuda.tile.store`
and :py:func:`cuda.tile.scatter`.

Scalar constants are |loosely typed| by default, for example, a literal ``2`` or
a constant attribute like ``Tile.ndim``, ``Tile.shape``, or ``Array.ndim``.

The *element space* of an array is the multidimensional space of its elements, stored in memory
according to a given layout (row-major, column-major, etc.).

The *tile space* of an array is the multidimensional space of tiles of a given tile shape within
that array. A tile index ``(i, j, ...)`` with shape ``S`` refers to the elements belonging to the
``(i+1)``-th, ``(j+1)``-th, ... tile.

When accessing array elements via tile indices, the array's multidimensional memory layout is used.
To access the tile space with a different layout, use the `order` parameter of load/store operations.

.. _data-tiled-views:

Tiled Views
-----------

A *tiled view* represents the |tile space| of a |global array|.

A tiled view's *num_tiles* is a tuple of integers, each denoting the number of tiles along
the corresponding dimension. The length of the *num_tiles* tuple equals the tile space's number
of dimensions, and the product of its values equals the total number of tiles in the tile space.

A tile in the tiled view can be loaded or stored by its tile index.

By default, consecutive tiles along each axis are adjacent with no overlap or gaps: the origin of
each successive tile advances by ``tile_shape[i]`` elements along axis *i*. Specifying
``traversal_steps`` to :meth:`Array.tiled_view` changes the advance per step to
``traversal_steps[i]``, producing overlapping tiles when ``traversal_steps[i] < tile_shape[i]``
or gapped tiles when ``traversal_steps[i] > tile_shape[i]``.

Shape Broadcasting
------------------

*Shape broadcasting* allows |tiles| with different shapes to be combined in arithmetic operations.
When an operation involves |tiles| of different shapes, the smaller |tile| is automatically
extended to match the larger one, following these rules:

- |Tiles| are aligned by their trailing dimensions.
- If the corresponding dimensions have the same size or one of them is 1, they are compatible.
- If one |tile| has fewer dimensions, its shape is padded with 1s on the left.

Broadcasting follows the same semantics as |NumPy|, keeping code concise and readable
while maintaining computational efficiency.

Numeric & Arithmetic Data Types
-------------------------------
A *numeric* data type represents numbers. An *arithmetic* data type is a numeric data type
that supports general arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication,
and division.


.. _data-arithmetic-promotion:

Arithmetic Promotion
--------------------

Binary operations can be performed on two |tile| or |scalar| operands of different |numeric dtypes|.

When both operands are |loosely typed numeric constants|, the result is also
a loosely typed constant: ``5 + 7`` is a loosely typed integral constant 12,
and ``5 + 3.0`` is a loosely typed floating-point constant 8.0.

If any of the operands is not a |loosely typed numeric constant|, both are *promoted*
to a common dtype as follows:

- Each operand is classified into one of the three categories:
  *boolean*, *integral*, or *floating-point*.
  The categories are ordered as follows: *boolean* < *integral* < *floating-point*.
- If either operand is a |loosely typed numeric constant|, a concrete dtype is picked for it:
  integral constants are treated as `int32`, `int64`, or `uint64`, depending on the value;
  floating-point constants are treated as `float32`.
- If one of the two operands has a higher category than the other, then its concrete dtype
  is chosen as the common dtype.
- If both operands are of the same category, but one of them is a |loosely typed numeric constant|,
  then the other operand's dtype is picked as the common dtype.
- Otherwise, the common dtype is computed according to the table below.
